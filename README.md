##About

As a female-led team, our goal is to raise awareness on a variety of women's issues and advocate for women’s
health & safety. We provide a safe environment for women and other marginalized groups to find information and ask for non-emergency assistance from their community. We see a world where all of our neighbors have access to supportive community, one where everyone works together to help one another. Our mission is to enhance the lives of those in need by offering our compassion, skills and services to all.

**Our concept is two-fold:**
1. We provide a dedicated space for women of all ages and allies of women to explore stories, articles, blogs, and advice on a wide range of women’s topics from family planning to health and exercise to women in the workplace.

2. We offer a wide range of services you can book with our fully vetted team of volunteers while also providing a safe and secure environment to request assistance. Whether you need your lawn mowed or someone to pick up your groceries or a ride to the clinic, we are here to help!
